This project works with SingleSignOn shared with the administration project.

This means that for deploying, administration also needs to be deployed and the 
web server need to have activated the SingleSignOn.

In tomcat 8 you just have to uncomment the next line in conf/server.xml: 

<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn" />
