!!!Description
The analysis section allows users to view graph data of detectors, spans and routes.
!!!Detectors
This link takes you to a page displaying the a list of all detectors visible to the user. Selecting a detector will take you to a page displaying a graph of total detections per 5 minutes over a 24 hour period along with a table holding the data used to generate the graph. 
!Graph Options
The graph options allow the user to manipulate the graph in the following ways.
* Start and end dates - Defines the period over which the data is retrieved.
* Unique detections - Defines whether multiple detections are counted once or repeatedly in the total.
!Table Options
The table options allow the user to export the data used to create the graph in CSV format. 

!!Spans
This link takes you to a page displaying the a list of all spans visible to the user. Selecting a span speed graph will take you to a page displaying a graph of speeds recorded over time. Selecting a span duration graph will take you to a page displaying a graph of journey durations recorded over time. Both graphs include a table holding the data used to generate the graph. 
!Graph Options
The graph options allow the user to manipulate the graph in the following ways.
* Start and end dates - Defines the period over which the data is retrieved.
* Maximum duration/speed - Defines the largest duration/speed which can be displayed on the graph.
* View detections/detection outliers - Defines whether detections and outliers are plotted on the graph along with the trend line.
* Trend type - Defines what averaging system(Mean,Median,Mode) is used to display the trend.  
!Table Options
The table options allow the user to export the data used to create the graph in CSV format. 

!!Routes
This link takes you to a page displaying the a list of all routes visible to the user. Selecting a route speed graph will take you to a page displaying a graph of speeds for each span in the route recorded over time. Selecting a route duration graph will take you to a page displaying a graph of journey durations for each span in the route recorded over time. Both graphs include a table holding the data used to generate the graph. 
!Graph Options
The graph options allow the user to manipulate the graph in the following ways.
* Start and end dates - Defines the period over which the data is retrieved.
* Trend type - Defines what averaging system(Mean,Median,Mode) is used to display the trend.
!Table Options
The table options allow the user to export the data used to create the graph in CSV format.
